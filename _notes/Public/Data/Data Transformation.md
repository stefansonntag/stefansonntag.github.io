Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format or structure to another in order to prepare it for analysis or other uses. This process typically involves cleaning, reformatting, and reorganizing data to ensure that it is consistent, accurate, and ready for use.

Data transformation may involve a range of activities, including:

-   [[Data Cleaning]]: Removing or correcting data that is incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent.
-   Data normalization: Structuring data so that it conforms to a standard format or schema.
-   Data aggregation: Combining multiple data sources or records into a single dataset.
-   Data enrichment: Adding additional data or information to a dataset to enhance its value.
-   Data filtering: Selecting or excluding specific data based on certain criteria.
-   Data mapping: Converting data from one format or system to another.

Data transformation is a critical step in the data processing pipeline and is often necessary to ensure that data is usable for a particular purpose, such as analysis or reporting. It is typically performed using specialized software tools or programming languages such as [[Python]], R, or [[SQL]].
