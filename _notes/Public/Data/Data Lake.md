A data lake is a centralized repository of raw, unprocessed, and unstructured data that is stored in its native format. Unlike a [[Data Warehouse]], which is designed to store structured data from specific sources, a data lake is designed to store vast amounts of data from a variety of sources, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

Data lakes are often used in [[Big Data]] environments where organizations need to store large volumes of data that may be used for a wide range of purposes, such as [[Machine Learning]], [[Data Mining]], and [[Predictive Analytics]]. They are also used to store data that may not have an immediate use case but may be useful in the future.

Data lakes are typically built using distributed storage systems, such as Hadoop or Amazon S3, which enable the data to be stored across multiple servers and easily scaled as needed. Because the data is stored in its native format, it can be processed and analyzed using a variety of tools and technologies, including machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and [[SQL]] - based querying languages.

However, the lack of structure in a data lake can make it difficult to access and analyze the data without the use of specialized tools and technologies. [[Data Governance]] and [[Data Quality]] also become more challenging in a data lake environment, as there may be no standardization or control over the data being added to the lake. As a result, data lakes require careful planning and management to ensure that they are effective in delivering the insights that businesses need.
