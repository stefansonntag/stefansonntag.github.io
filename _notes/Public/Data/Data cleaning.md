Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. The main goal of data cleaning is to improve the quality of the data, making it more accurate, reliable, and useful for analysis or other purposes.

The process of data cleaning typically involves the following steps:

1.  Identify missing or incorrect data: Review the dataset to identify missing, incomplete, or inaccurate data.
2.  Remove duplicates: Identify and remove any duplicate data points to avoid data redundancy.
3.  Correct inconsistencies: Check for inconsistencies in data, such as inconsistencies in spelling, capitalization, or date formats, and correct them.
4.  Validate data: Verify the accuracy of data against a set of predefined rules, such as data ranges or data types.
5.  Handle missing data: Decide how to handle missing data, such as removing the data point or filling in the missing value with an estimated value based on statistical analysis.
6.  Normalize data: Standardize data to ensure it is consistent across the dataset.

Data cleaning is a critical step in the [[Business Analytics]]  process as it helps to ensure that the results of the analysis are accurate and reliable. By identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies, data cleaning improves the quality of the data, making it more useful for decision-making, research, or other purposes.
