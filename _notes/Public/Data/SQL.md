SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL is used to create, modify, and query databases and their tables, columns, and relationships.

Relational databases organize data into one or more tables that are related to each other in some way. SQL is used to define the structure of the tables, insert and update data in the tables, and retrieve data from the tables based on various criteria.

SQL has a variety of commands that are used to interact with databases, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. These commands are used to create tables, add or modify data in tables, and retrieve data from tables based on specific conditions.

SQL is used by a wide range of organizations, including businesses, governments, and non-profit organizations, to manage their data assets. It is also used by developers and data analysts to extract insights from data stored in a [[Database]].

SQL is a standardized language, which means that it can be used with different types of databases, including Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others. This makes it easy to transfer data between different systems and applications.

Proficiency in SQL is a valuable skill for anyone working with data or in a technical role that requires interacting with a [[Database]]. Many software developers, data analysts, and database administrators use SQL as a key tool in their daily work.
