Data lineage is the process of tracking and documenting the flow of data throughout its lifecycle, from its creation to its final destination. It involves understanding the origin of data, its transformation as it moves through different systems and applications, and its ultimate usage in reports or analysis. Data lineage helps to establish a clear understanding of the data's history, and it provides a comprehensive view of the data's journey from its origin to its end use.

Data lineage is important because it provides valuable information about the data's accuracy, completeness, and reliability. It enables organizations to identify where data came from, how it was transformed, and who accessed it. By tracing the data's lineage, organizations can ensure that data is properly used and managed, and that it is compliant with regulatory requirements.

The process of establishing data lineage involves capturing [[Metadata]], which is data about the data itself. [[Metadata]] includes information about the data's source, its location, its format, and the transformations that it has undergone. [[Metadata]] is typically captured through the use of tools and systems that are designed to track and document the flow of data.

Data lineage can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

1.  [[Data Quality]] Assurance: By tracking the lineage of data, organizations can identify potential issues or errors in the data, and take corrective action to improve data quality.
    
2.  Compliance: Data lineage helps organizations to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements, by showing how data is captured, transformed, and used.
    
3.  Impact Analysis: Data lineage helps organizations to understand the impact of changes to data, such as changes to data structures or data sources.
    
4.  Risk Management: Data lineage helps organizations to identify potential risks associated with data usage, such as unauthorized access or data breaches.
    

In summary, data lineage is the process of tracking and documenting the flow of data throughout its lifecycle. It is an essential process for ensuring that data is properly managed and used, and that it is compliant with regulatory requirements.
