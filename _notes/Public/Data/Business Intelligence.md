Business intelligence (BI) is a set of tools, techniques, and processes used to analyze and transform raw data into meaningful and actionable insights that can be used to support decision-making and strategic planning in a business or organization.

BI is a broad category that encompasses many different types of analysis and reporting, including[[Data Mining]], [[Predictive Analytics]], and visualizations. The goal of BI is to help organizations gain a deeper understanding of their business operations, customers, and market trends, in order to make more informed decisions and improve overall performance.

BI tools and techniques are used to extract data from various sources, transform it into a common format, and store it in a centralized repository such as a [[Data Warehouse]]. This data can then be analyzed using statistical methods and other analytical techniques to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.

BI is widely used across many industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing, among others. Some examples of how BI can be applied in a business context include identifying sales trends, analyzing customer behavior, optimizing supply chain operations, and predicting future demand.
