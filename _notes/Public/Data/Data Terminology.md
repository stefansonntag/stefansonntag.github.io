I've worked in companies that generate their revenue by processing or analyzing data at scale for the last 15 years, i.e. half oy my career. One would assume that in that industry the terminology used by employees regarding the data realm is well defined, i.e. everyone has the same understanding of what they mean when they say for example Data Engineering, Predictive Analytics and so forth. But no. I've spend too many hours in meetings, sales calls etc., chasing down a wrong path, only to find out later that something entirely else was meant by "Dashboard" or "Database" and the term was simply used because the speaker "felt" he was using the correct one.

That said, there really aren't too many terms in that field so I thought I use ChatGPT to assemble a small dictionary of some of the most frequent and important ones.

By no means does this collection claim to be complete, nor does it reflect the ultimate truth. Some terms are indeed wider defined than others, but overall the output of ChatGPT is quite correct and represents what I heard consistently over the last decades and what most would understand by these terms, so I consider this to be a reliable and useful starting point.

Note: there are  many commercial products and open source solutions out there which are frequently cited or used in this field. Having some knowledge about what roughly they do has proven to be helpful to structure this domain a bit better. (e.g. what is Spark, SIIS, etc.)
