A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. It can be thought of as an electronic filing system that stores information about people, products, events, and other objects of interest to an organization.

A database typically consists of one or more tables, each of which contains rows and columns of data. The tables are related to each other in some way, either through primary and foreign keys or through other types of relationships. The structure of the database is defined by its schema, which specifies the types of data that can be stored in each table and the relationships between tables.

Databases can be stored on a variety of platforms, including on-premises servers, cloud servers, or hybrid environments. They are used by organizations of all sizes and types, from small businesses to large enterprises, to manage their data assets and support their business operations.

Databases are used in a wide range of applications, including inventory management, customer relationship management, financial reporting, and healthcare systems. They enable organizations to store and retrieve data more efficiently, improve data accuracy and consistency, and support better decision-making through data analysis and reporting.

Excel, Google Sheets or a collection of documents in a folder are not databases.
