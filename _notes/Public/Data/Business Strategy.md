Business strategy refers to the set of actions, decisions, and plans that a company undertakes to achieve its long-term goals and objectives. It involves identifying the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis), assessing the competitive landscape, and developing a plan to gain a competitive advantage in the market.

Business strategy typically involves determining the company's target market, product or service offerings, pricing strategies, marketing and sales tactics, operational processes, and resource allocation. The ultimate goal of a business strategy is to create sustainable competitive advantage, increase revenue, and maximize profits.

Effective business strategy requires a deep understanding of the industry, market, customers, and competition. It also involves continuous evaluation and adaptation of the strategy based on changing market conditions and customer needs.
