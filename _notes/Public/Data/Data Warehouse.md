A data warehouse is a centralized and integrated repository of data that is used for [[Reporting and Analytics]]. It is designed to support [[Business Intelligence]] activities by providing a single, unified view of an organization's data from various sources.

Data warehouses are specifically designed to handle large amounts of data, often from different sources and in different formats. They are optimized for querying and reporting, with the goal of providing easy access to data for analysis and decision-making.

Data warehouses are typically used by organizations that have a large amount of data that needs to be analyzed and reported on a regular basis. Examples of such organizations include retail businesses, financial institutions, healthcare providers, and government agencies.

Data warehouses typically use a process called ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to collect data from various sources, transform it into a common format, and load it into the data warehouse. Once the data is in the warehouse, it can be queried using specialized reporting and analysis tools to support decision-making and strategic planning.
