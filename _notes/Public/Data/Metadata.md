Metadata is information that describes other data. It provides context and helps to organize, identify, and manage data. In other words, it is data about data.

Metadata can include a variety of information, such as the date the data was created, the author or creator of the data, the file type and size, keywords and tags, and the location or directory where the data is stored. It can also include technical information such as the resolution and bit depth of an image or the encoding format of a video or audio file.

Metadata is used in many different contexts, including in digital media, databases, scientific research, and archives. It helps to facilitate the discovery and retrieval of data, and can also help to ensure the accuracy, quality, and security of data.
