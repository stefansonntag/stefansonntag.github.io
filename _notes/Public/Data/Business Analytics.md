Business analytics is the practice of using data, statistical methods, and computational techniques to extract insights and knowledge from business data, with the goal of improving business decision-making and outcomes. Business analytics can involve a range of activities, including data mining, predictive modeling, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

Business analytics typically involves the use of various tools and technologies, including data management systems, statistical software, and [[Machine Learning]] algorithms, among others. The process of business analytics can be broken down into several stages, including data collection, [[Data cleaning]] and preprocessing, data analysis in dashboards (ref. example [[Corporate Performance Dashboard]]), and interpretation and decision-making.

The insights generated through business analytics can be used to inform a wide range of business decisions, including product development, customer segmentation, marketing strategies, financial forecasting, and resource allocation. By leveraging data-driven insights, organizations can gain a competitive advantage, improve efficiency, and make more informed decisions.

Overall, business analytics is an essential component of modern business strategy, enabling organizations to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions that can improve outcomes and drive growth.
