The terms reporting and analytics are often used interchangeably. This is not surprising since both take in data as “input” — which is then processed and presented in the form of charts, graphs, or dashboards.

Reports and analytics help businesses improve operational efficiency and productivity, but in different ways. While reports explain what is happening, analytics helps identify why it is happening. Reporting summarizes and organizes data in static formats (list, chart) while analytics enables questioning and exploring that via interaction with the data further. Thus it provides invaluable insights into trends and helps create strategies to help improve operations, customer satisfaction, growth, and other business metrics.

Reporting and analysis are both important for an organization to make informed decisions by presenting data in a format that is easy to understand. In reporting, data is brought together usually from one source (e.g. Salesforce) and presented in an easy-to-consume format. Typically,   reporting apps offer simple dashboards with high-level data visualization capabilities that present the actual state of the data. Also, the presentation is unidirectional in that it typically does not allow further filtering of the data in the report. For that, new reports need to be built, which can be a time consuming process and may require the help of others. But for further insights, to filter the data by region, by quarter, by team, by campaign, by lead source (or any combination therof) and to combine different data sources (e.g. Salesforce for campaign management and LinkedIn for advertisement conversion rates) it requires analytics.

Analytics enables business users to cull out insights from data from various sources, spot trends, and help make better decisions. Next-generation analytics takes advantage of emerging technologies like AI, NLP, and machine learning to offer predictive insights based on historical and real-time data.

To run analytics, reporting is not necessary.

For instance, let us take a look at a a typical Salesforce Dashboard

While this dashboard proves very useful information such as different types of leads converting to MQL, it does not help answer the question for example how many MQL converted by lead owner or how many disqualified at a later stage. To answer either one of these questions one will have to run a report and look at the detail data that sits behind a chart.

Here you get the details, summarized by quarter, so it helps to understand the time aspect, but not the aspect how the data breaks down per lead owner: for that one would have to either count manually (as the information "Lead Owner" is provided in the report) or build a complete new report that summarizes by lead owner instead of quarter. This requires additional manual work, often  done by others who have specialized skills, so a dependency is introduced which leads to delays.

Contrast that with an analytics dashboard

Here you have both high level summarization of data (the KPIs across the screen, could also be presented as charts) and you have the details that make up the results of the KPI all on the same page, so there is no need to flip between dashboards aand reports. In addition you can filter by various criteria (e.g. quarter, month, region and subregion) in any combination and the data will instantly recalculate the KPI's according to how you set your filters. This is self-service, you don't need anyone to modify existing reports or to build new ones. In addition, you instantly also drill down to the most granular level of the data and can see what causes the KPI results (e.g. a certain campaign does not generate pipe but has more than 100 MQL). That leads to very relevant business questions and decision: Why is that the case, what is special about the campaign? What is missing, what do we need to do? Who else might be needed? 

So this is the fundamental difference between reporting and analytics: reporting allows to see static information in a singular and rather simplistic way and requires additional work to get more insights. In that sense reporting is unidrectional: data is summarized, delivered to the user and ends there. Analytics on the other hand provides the same aggregation, but also an environment to have a dialague with the data by limitless filtering, slicing and dicing and therefore allows to discover root causes and other insight and dwith that rive action and business decisions all without the help of others.

Both simple reporting and analytics have their place. If all you want is to look at a few numbers and don't want to break them down or look at them from various angles, then reporting is the way to go. When looking at a report you think that you would want to see the information broken down by something else, then quite likely analytics would be more suitable.
